Angular Review Exercise 4
=========================
Re-use as much code as possible from other projects to build a project that uses the SWAPI service
	https://swapi.dev/api/
Configure a service to accept a category and a number
	https://swapi.co/api/people/1     (or starships, species, planets, vehicles)
Configure a form to accept validated inputs for a category and a number
Pass these to the service and handle the returned data

You could do this by putting the form and the results into separate components

The returned data is different for each catergory, but they all have a 'name' property
So you could have a 'Swapi' class and other classes inherit from this

Generate a production build of this application

Optional
--------
In ngOnInit make an initial call to load a JSON config file, 
containing default category and number values
Pass the category and the number as URL parameters into a routed component which uses the URL parameters to make a call and show results
Devise a couple of tests for your components
When a request is returned, immediately make a further requests for the related films
(handle multiple streams with a suitable rxjs operator)
