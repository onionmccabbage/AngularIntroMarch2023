Angular Review Exercise 2 1hr 15mins at least (until about 3:00)
=========================
A new app will offer fields for 'city' and for 'country'
A button will call a service to retrieve the weather for that city/country
The weather description and temperature will be displayed

Details
-------
Create a new app (ng new review2) without routing
Generate a component and provide two <input> tags and a <button>
Declare properties for 'cityPlaceholder', 'countryPlaceholder' and 'btnLabel'
Bind these to the <input> placeholders and the <button> text

Generate a service and implement a method to get data from
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=london,gb&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1
(replace city and country with user-supplied values)

When the user fills in the form and clicks the button, invoke a call to a method of this service
From the returned JSON, show description and temperature (converted to Celcius by subtracting 273)
	e.g. myWeatherData.weatherDescription = this.weatherReport.weather[0].description

Optional
--------
When the app first loads call some default weather data using ngOnInit
Configure a default (click) handler for the button which then emits a custom event
Handle this custom event in the parent component, where you make the actual service call
Pass the returned weather data down into another component for display

Show a few more weather data members, such as wind-speed and direction
Offer a drop-down for the country field
  For example, suggest bg, gb, fr, de, ei, es, it, usa, uae, aus, ru (from a local data set)
Validate that there is a 2-3 letter country code and the city is a non-empty string
