Angular Review Exercise 1
=========================
The user will type into an input field and any matching publicFaceBook image will be displayed

Details:
--------
Create a new Angular project called 'review1': 	ng new review1
Delete everything inside app.component.html
Then render an input element and an image
Declare a model in the .ts file
Bind whatever the user types into the input element to this model
Find an elegant way to render the FaceBook image
For example this works:
  https://graph.facebook.com/billgates/picture?type=normal

Ideas
-----
you could do this using {{}} in the image src value
or you could derive the URL and bind using [src]=...

Optional
--------
If the input element is empty, do not show any image (use *ngIf)
